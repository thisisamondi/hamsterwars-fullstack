HAMSTERWARS FULLSTACK

**This was a fullstack assignment I got from school**

In the assignment we got pictures and objects containing fictional hamsters :D 
We we're then assigned to create an API and import them to our database to access all of the hamsters in the frontend. 
Also to create status codes to evaluate our app along the way and catch errors.

Created the frontend app in React with Typescript. 

Design by me with a mockup I first made in figma:

I also used Heroku to publish and operate the app
